% The Lattice

Lattice gauge theory is a method to regularize a quantum gauge theory nonperturbatively.
To date it is the only controlled way to study strongly coupled systems from first principals.
Lattice methods have been extremely successful in studying the strong nuclear force and many Lattice QCD results are now at the sub percent accuracy.
As a mature field there are many excellent books on the subject that go above and beyond the level of rigor that I will pursue in the following discussion \cite{degrand:book,smit:book,gattringer:book}.
My aim is to provide some technical details relevant to the calculations that I perform in later chapters and give the reader a flavor of the subject.

The lattice regularizes the theory by discretizing Euclidean spacetime onto a regular grid of sites which are connected by links.
The most common discretization is that of a four dimensional hypercube.
For simplicity I will assume that all the sides of our hypercube are of length L (volume $L^4$), although this is not necessary and is in fact not true of many lattice calculations.
