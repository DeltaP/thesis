The Wilson flow is a continuous smearing transformation~\cite{Narayanan:2006rf} that removes UV fluctuations without changing the lattice scale, as shown in \fig{fig:wflow_opt}.
In perturbation theory it is related to the \MSbar running coupling~\cite{Luscher:2010iy}, and can be used to compute a renormalized step-scaling function~\cite{Fodor:2012td, Fodor:2012qh}.

In this work we use the Wilson flow to optimize MCRG two-lattice matching with a fixed RG blocking transformation (renormalization scheme).
The Wilson flow continuously moves the system on a surface of constant lattice scale in the infinite-dimensional space of lattice-action couplings.
We tune the flow time to bring the system as close as possible to the renormalized trajectory.
After running the optimal amount of Wilson flow on the unblocked lattices, we then carry out the MCRG two-lattice matching.
Because the renormalization scheme is fixed, we obtain a bare step-scaling function that corresponds to a unique discrete \be function.
