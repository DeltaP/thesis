% Higgs Mechanism

In the standard model the W and Z bosons are massive but the photon is massless.
Since gauge invariance dictates that a mass term is forbidden in the Lagrangian this seems to pose a problem.
Disaster is averted because SU(2)xU(1) is spontaneously broken to U(1) E\&M.
In the standard model this is accomplished by adding a complex scalar doublet field to the mix.
The field is named the Higgs field after one of its discoverers.
The Higgs field is charged under electroweak interactions.
Through the electroweak breaking the Higgs field aquires a VEV which allows the W and Z to gain a mass.
Additionally the Higgs field allows the fermions in the standard model to acquire a mass by coupling to the Higgs field via Yukawa couplings.

The Higgs Boson, a particle excitations of the Higgs field, was recently discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
