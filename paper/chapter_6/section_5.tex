% Summary

In this proceedings we have shown how the Wilson-flow-optimized MCRG two-lattice matching procedure proposed in \refcite{Petropoulos:2012mg} improves upon traditional lattice renormalization group techniques.
By optimizing the flow time for a fixed RG blocking transformation, WMCRG predicts a bare step-scaling function $s_b$ that corresponds to a unique discrete \be function.
Applying WMCRG to new 12-flavor ensembles generated with exactly massless fermions, we observe an infrared fixed point in $s_b$.
The fixed point is present for all investigated lattice volumes, number of blocking steps and renormalization schemes, even after accounting for systematic effects indicated by \fig{fig:scheme1}.
This result reinforces the IR-conformal interpretation of our complementary $N_f = 12$ studies of phase transitions~\cite{Schaich:2012fr, Hasenfratz:2013uha}, the Dirac eigenmode number~\cite{Cheng:2013eu, Cheng:2013bca}, and finite-size scaling~\cite{Hasenfratz:2013eka}.

As an alternative to optimizing the RG blocking transformation, and thus changing the renormalization scheme at each coupling $\be_F$, here we propose to use the Wilson flow to move the lattice system as close as possible to the renormalized trajectory of a fixed renormalization scheme.

The Wilson flow is a continuous smearing transformation~\cite{Narayanan:2006rf} that can be related to the \MSbar running coupling in perturbation theory~\cite{Luscher:2010iy}.
Refs.~\cite{Fodor:2012td, Fodor:2012qh} recently used the Wilson flow to compute a renormalized step-scaling function in a way similar to Schr\"odinger functional methods.
While this approach appears very promising, it is based on perturbative relations that are only fully reliable at weak coupling.
Here we do not use this perturbative connection, instead applying the Wilson flow as a continuous smearing that removes UV fluctuations.
The Wilson flow moves the system along a surface of constant lattice scale in the infinite-dimensional action-space; it is not a renormalization group transformation and does not change the IR properties of the system.

Our goal is to use a one-parameter Wilson flow transformation to move the lattice system as close as possible to the renormalized trajectory of our fixed RG blocking transformation.
We proceed by carrying out two-lattice matching after applying the Wilson flow for a flow time $t_f$ on all lattice volumes.
(The Wilson flow is run only on the unblocked lattices, not in between RG blocking steps.)
As above, since we can block our lattices only a few times, we must optimize $t_f$ by requiring that consecutive RG blocking steps yield the same $\De\be_F$, as shown in the right panel of \fig{fig:opt}.
As for traditional MCRG, increasing the number of blocking steps reduces the dependence on the optimization parameter; in the limit $n_b \to \infty$, our results would be independent of $t_f$.

With Wilson-flowed MCRG we can efficiently determine bare step-scaling functions that correspond to unique RG \be functions.
This new capability opens up interesting directions for future studies.
By comparing different \be functions around the perturbative gaussian FP, we can study scaling violations in the lattice system.
In IR-conformal systems, we can investigate the scheme-dependence of the \be function near the IRFP, an issue explored in perturbation theory by \refcite{Ryttov:2012nt}.

\subsection{\label{sec:WMCRGresults}Wilson-flowed MCRG} % Draft complete
\fig{fig:WMCRG} presents our results for the bare step-scaling function $s_b$ from Wilson-flowed MCRG two-lattice matching.
We continue using two sequential HYP smearings in our RG blocking transformation, but now fix the smearing parameters to $(0.5, 0.2, 0.2)$.
We again use $24^3\X48$ and $12^3\X24$ lattices with fermion masses $m = 0.0025$ and $m = 0.01$, respectively, and determine uncertainties in the same way as described in the previous subsection.
In this preliminary study we don't yet employ the volume-corrected optimization discussed in \refcite{Hasenfratz:2011xn}; for our lattice volumes, \refcite{Hasenfratz:2011xn} found that neglecting this finite-volume correction introduces only a small additional error.
Our final results will use the appropriate optimization, and will also present further consistency checks from larger lattices up to $32^3\X64$.

While our results in \fig{fig:WMCRG} from combining the Wilson flow with MCRG two-lattice matching are qualitatively similar to the results of the traditional approach in \fig{fig:MCRG}, we can now identify the bare step-scaling function $s_b$ with a unique discrete \be function.
In the renormalization scheme defined by our RG blocking transformation with HYP-smearing parameters $(0.5, 0.2, 0.2)$, we find a 12-flavor IRFP at $5 < \be_F^{\star} \lsim 6$.
Although $\be_F^{\star}$ is scheme-dependent, the existence of this IRFP is physical.
We are currently exploring other choices of renormalization schemes, to non-perturbatively investigate the scheme-dependence of the \be function near the IRFP~\cite{Ryttov:2012nt}.
At weaker couplings, we will also attempt to use similar explorations to study scaling violations in our lattice systems.
