% The Lattice

Lattice gauge theory is a method to regularize a quantum gauge theory nonperturbatively.
To date it is the only controled way to study strongly coupled systems from first principals.
Lattice methods have been extremely sucessful in studying the strong nuclear force and many Lattice QCD results are now at the sub percentage accuracy.
The lattice regularizes the theory by discretizing Euclidian spacetime onto a regular grid of sites which are connected by links.
The most common discritization is that of a four dimensional hypercube.
For simplicity I will assume that all the sides of our hypercube are of length L (volume $L^4$), although this is not necessrary and is infact not true of many lattice calculations.

(anything else to say about discritization?)
