% Composite Higgs

Another approach to solve the hierarchy problem is for the Higgs to be a composite composed of particles from a new strongly interacting sector.
This new sector is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking.
There are many types of theories that use such a modus operandi.
While these theories have the benefits of ... they typically favor a heavier Higgs mass than what has been observed.
Additionally, these theories are highly constrained by precision electroweak measurements.
In the next three subsections I will give a flavor for two classes of composite Higgs theories, introduce the conformal window, and discuss the state of Lattice endeavors in this area.
