Strongly coupled quantum field theories play a vial part in our current understanding of the universe.
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is responsible for 95\% of the mass that is a consequence of the standard model.

Additionally, new strong dynamics can serve as a means to extend the standard model (SM).
A number of researchers are currently working to explore new strong dynamics.
From a lattice perspective this means looking for theories that are strongly coupled but behave differently form QCD.
One systematic systematic approach is to take the QCD Lagrangian, SU(3) $N_f$ = 2 (or 2+1, 2+1+1, etc), and change the number of flavors, $N_f$.

It is known that
