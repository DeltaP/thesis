% MCRG Results

The renormalization group has been used to study the SU(3) $N_f = 12$ system already [cite anna].
These results show that the theory is clearly conformal.
The action used in these simulations is ...
As part of a greater effort to study this system further we changed our action to reach stronger coupling.
In this section I will present our results using MCRG with the changed action.

\subsection{The Simulation}
To achieve stronger coupling we use a different lattice action.  
This action has [details about action]
