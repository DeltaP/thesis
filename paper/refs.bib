abstract = {We present details of a lattice study of infrared behaviour in SU(3) gauge theory with twelve massless fermions in the fundamental representation. Using the step-scaling method, we compute the coupling constant in this theory over a large range of scale. The renormalisation scheme in this work is defined by the ratio of Polyakov loops in the directions with different boundary conditions. We closely examine systematic effects, and find that they are dominated by errors arising from the continuum extrapolation. Our investigation suggests that SU(3) gauge theory with twelve flavours contains an infrared fixed point.},

abstract = {I investigate an SU(3) gauge model with 12 fundamental fermions. The physically interesting region of this strongly coupled system can be influenced by an ultraviolet fixed point due to lattice artifacts. I suggest to use a gauge action with an additional negative adjoint plaquette term that lessens this problem. I also introduce a new analysis method for the 2-lattice matching Monte Carlo renormalization group technique that significantly reduces finite volume effects. The combination of these two improvements allows me to measure the bare step scaling function in a region of the gauge coupling where it is clearly negative, indicating a positive renormalization group \$\backslash beta\$ function and infrared conformality.},

We list necessary conditions that such transformations must obey and show that, although these can easily be satisfied in the vicinity of an ultraviolet fixed point, they constitute significant restrictions on scheme transformations at an infrared fixed point. We construct acceptable scheme transformations and use these to study the scheme-dependence of an infrared fixed point, making comparison with our previous three-loop and four-loop calculations of the location of this point in the \$\backslash bar\{MS\}\$ scheme. We also use an illustrative hypothetical exact \$\backslash beta\$ function to investigate how accurately analyses of finite-order series expansions probe an infrared fixed point and the effect of a scheme transformation on these. Some implications of our work are discussed.},

abstract = {Theoretical and numerical studies of the Wilson flow in lattice QCD suggest that the gauge field obtained at flow time t>0 is a smooth renormalized field. The expectation values of local gauge-invariant expressions in this field are thus well-defined physical quantities that probe the theory at length scales on the order of sqrt(t). Moreover, by transforming the QCD functional integral to an integral over the gauge field at a specified flow time, the emergence of the topological (instanton) sectors in the continuum limit becomes transparent and is seen to be caused by a dynamical effect that rapidly separates the sectors when the lattice spacing is reduced from 0.1 fm to smaller values.},

abstract = {We study the SU(3) gauge theory with Nf=12 flavors in the fundamental representation by use of lattice simulations with staggered fermions. With a non-improved action we observe a chiral zero-temperature (bulk) transition separating a region at weak coupling, where chiral symmetry is realized, from a region at strong coupling where chiral symmetry is broken. With improved actions, a more complicated pattern emerges, and in particular two first order transitions in the chiral limit appear. We observe that at sufficiently strong coupling the next-to-nearest neighbor terms of the improved lattice action are no longer irrelevant and can indeed modify the pattern observed without improvement. Baryon number conservation can be realized in an unusual way, allowing for an otherwise prohibited oscillating term in the pseudoscalar channel. We discuss the phenomenon by means of explicit examples borrowed from statistical mechanics. Finally, these observations can also be useful when simulating other strongly coupled systems on the lattice, such as graphene. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Fodor2012b,
abstract = {The Yang-Mills gradient flow is considered on the four dimensional torus T\^{}4 for SU(N) gauge theory coupled to N\_f flavors of massless fermions in arbitrary representations. The small volume dynamics is dominated by the constant gauge fields. The expectation value of the field strength tensor squared is calculated for positive flow time t by treating the non-zero gauge modes perturbatively and the zero modes exactly. The finite volume correction to the infinite volume result is found to contain both algebraic and exponential terms. The leading order result is then used to define a one parameter family of running coupling schemes in which the coupling runs with the linear size of the box. The new scheme is tested numerically in SU(3) gauge theory coupled to N\_f = 4 flavors of massless fundamental fermions. The calculations are performed at several lattice spacings with a controlled continuum extrapolation. The continuum result agrees with the perturbative 2-loop prediction for small renormalized coupling as expected.},

@article{Cheng2012,
abstract = {We study the phase structure of SU(3) lattice gauge theory with Nf=12 fundamental fermions at both zero and finite temperature at strong gauge couplings. For small fermion masses we find two transitions at finite temperature that converge to two well-separated bulk phase transitions. This behavior is consistent with an IR-conformal phase at weak coupling. The phase between the two transitions appears to be a novel phase: it is confining but has a very small, possibly vanishing, chiral condensate. The meson spectrum also shows unusual properties in this phase. Our data suggest that this phase is chirally broken by a higher-dimensional condensate.},
