% The Standard Model

Our current understanding of the universe postulates that there are four fundamental forces in nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.
The latter three forces are understood in terms of quantum field theories which form the Standard Model (SM).
The Standard Model is a $SU(3)_cxSU(2)_WxU(1)_Y$ gauge theory.

The $SU(3)_c$ component of the theory explains the strong nuclear force, also called quantum crhomodynamics (QCD).
This force consists of spin 1/2 quarks possessing `color' charge interract by exchanging gluons.
It is important to note that this color charge has nothing to do with visible colors and is analagous to electric charge.
Unlike electric charge which can be expressed by only one number, color charge is expressed by three numberes.
The gulons are also charged under SU(3) which leads to a much richer class of fundamental interractions.
The strong nuclear force is responsible for the proton, composed of two up and one down quark, and neutron, composed of two down and one up quark.
Additionally, the strong nuclear force binds these particles together to form atomic nuclei.
Most of the understood mass in the universe is a result of the strong nuclear force.

The remaining $SU(2)_WxU(1)_Y$ part of the standard model is the electroweak force.
This is the quantum field theory that explains the quantum theory of electrodynamics and how particles decay via the weak process .
An essential feature of the electroweak theory is that $SU(2)_WxU(1)_Y$ spontaneously breaks down to $U(1)_{EM}$ see section \ref{sec:higgs_mech} for further details.
$U(1)_EM$ is the effective theory of quantum electrodynamics in which spin 1/2 fermionic matter charged with electric charge interracts by exchanging photos.
Unlike in QCD photons are not charged under U(1) and therefore don't interract at tree level.
This yields a much simpler theory than QCD and can be understood perturbatively.

In both the QCD and Electroweak sector matter is divided into three generations of matter.
The first generation of matter is the most familiar.
It consists of the up quark down quark, electron, and electron neutrino.
All of the matter that we experience in our daily lives is made of this generation of matter.
The other two generations of matter are essentially heavier replicas of the first generation.
These heavier generations rapidly decay via the weak nuclear force to the first generation of matter and therefore are only detected in high energy events such as cosmic rays or particle physics experiments.
The second consists of the strange quark, charm quark, muon, and muon neutrino.
Finally the third consists of the top quark, bottom quark, tau, and tau neutrino.
The properties of all the standard model particles is summarized in table \ref{table:sm}.
