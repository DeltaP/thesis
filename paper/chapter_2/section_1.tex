% The Standard Model

Our current understanding of the universe postulates that there are four fundamental forces in nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.
The latter three forces are understood in terms of quantum field theories whch for the Standard Model (SM).
Each theory describes the world as consisting of fermionic matter particles coupled by bosonic force carriers.
In Quantum Electrodynamics the electron, muon, and tau interact via photons.
Quantum Chromodynamics the matter particles are quarks and they interact by exchanging gluons.
